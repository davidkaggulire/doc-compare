## Doc-compare
This app helps you compare your documents for differences. All the comparisons are handled on the backend. Differences are viewed in terms of metadata of the files to view if anything was tampered with. In this way document security can be checked.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Frontend
many libraries have given life to this project such as jspdf, react-icons, and react-dropzone.

## Backend
It is currently hosted on fly.io and also using render service.
However fly is not a free service so is render for document uploads.
